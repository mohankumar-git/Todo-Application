This is a basic to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to add, check, and delete tasks in your to-do list.

## Features

- Check tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks from your to-do list.
- Automatically saves your to-do list in local storage.

## Getting Started

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the to-do list app.

## Usage

- To add a new task, type the task in the input field and click the "Add" button.

- To mark a task as completed, click the checkbox next to the task.

- To delete a task, click the trash icon next to the task.
